  /**
   * Immutable Maps
   *
   * Maps are collections where one value, the key, maps to another, the value.
   * The types need not be the same.
   *
   * Scala guesses the type of the Map from the elements included.
   *
   * The quickest way to create a Map is like this:
   *  val myMap = Map( key1 -> value1, key2 -> value2, ...)
   *
   * To access an element, you do like this:
   *  myMap(key1)  // output: value1
   *
   * (the best way is with the "get" method shown below, but
   * you can ignore that for now; it returns an Option, which you'll
   * see, or saw, in another tutorial)
   *
   * You can add an element simply with "+".
   * Example:
   *  Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2) + ("c" -> 3)
   * Or you can combine two maps like this:
   *  Map("a" -> 1, "b" -> 2) ++ Map("c" -> 3, "d" -> 4)
   *
   * NOTE that you don't modify the existing map, you get a new one.
   *
   * You can ask all the keys of a Map with the "keys" method.
   * Similarly, you can ask the values of a Map with... (that's right)
   *
   * Our friend Fred went for dinner at the pub, and then
   * bought an ice-cream on the street. Change the code to reflect this.
   * We also want to know the name of the items he consumed which have
   * an "e" on it.
   *
   * HINT: filters the keys for the consumed items
   * HINT: you can use the method "sum" to add a list of numbers
   * Bonus: implement your own sum with "reduce"
